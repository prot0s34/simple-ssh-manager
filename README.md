Lightweight ssh manager, support several jumphost options and multiply host list group.
Written in Go with tview and kubernetes libraries.

inventory:
- support multiply lists in one inventory file
- support per-list jumphost and kubejumphost configs
- inventory should be in /home/$user/inventory.json or defined in ENV SSHMANAGER_INVENTORY=/path/to/inventory.json
- regular host, kubernetes pod or both (kubernetes -> jumphost -> targethost) can be used as jump option

How-To Use:
```
go build sshmanager.go
cp sshmanager /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sshmanager
```
